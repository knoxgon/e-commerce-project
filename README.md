## Project is hosted at http://efurn.surge.sh

### Kickoff date - 12-Mar/2020 - Deadline - 22-Mar/2020

## Purpose

It is a hobby project in parallel with schoolwork and other private projects. I'm highly intrested in finance, stock market, banking and e-commerce. The core reason is to sharpen my skills in different techniques/frameworks/libraries used within ReactJS thus perform it simultaneously.

## Why is ReactJs chosen?

I've previously used angular but truth to be told, the ReactJs and vue are better with handling the single page applications and the ultimate tool towards the creation of hobby projects.

### run `npm install` followed by `npm start`
